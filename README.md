Classification of Red Wine Dataset

**Abstract**
This project presents a method for categorizing wines from Portugal's Minho region into quality categories. Using a dataset of 1599 observations, we developed classifiers to range wine quality from 3 (low) to 8 (high). We employed five classification techniques: k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, random forest, and naïve bayes, with random forest showing the lowest error rate.

**Introduction**
The project addresses the challenge of quantifying wine quality, considering physicochemical and intrinsic factors like flavor and aroma. We aim to assist winemakers in enhancing product quality through data-driven insights.

**Methodology**
Data Preparation: Utilized a dataset of "Vinho Verde" wines, focusing on variables impacting quality.
Handling Imbalanced Data: Addressed data imbalance using Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE).
Models Used: Five machine learning techniques were employed, with a focus on the random forest for its superior performance.

**Results**
The random forest model outperformed others, achieving an accuracy of 69.85%. The use of SMOTE did not significantly alter model outcomes.

**Conclusion**
The study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting wine quality. Future work includes combining random forest with robust algorithms like Genetic Algorithm for enhanced predictions.
